# Up up and away - a useless website

This is a useless website I made for my first JavaScript course @yrgo. In this website you can click anywhere to spawn balloons, and then make them up up and away!

The website can be found at www.upupandaway.netlify.app.

# Code Review by Agnes Skönvall

1. first.css:34 - Great work with the css-variables, but try to use them for all colors for consistency.
2. first.js:5  - keypress-eventlistener is unfortunately not available on mobile. Perhaps something else would work better on mobile, like touch on a button? Just to make it useless even on mobile devices!
3. index.html:21-31 - I assume these are notes for your own reference. Delete them before making your project public! Also make sure to add a license to your project!
4. first.js:13-15 - I don’t really understand the point of printing the coordinates of the balloons on the webpage. Just logging them in the console works better if you want to save them for future reference. I would advice you not to print them as they just confuse the user.
5. first.css:89-108 - Your code is very readable, good job! Although this section is a bit confusing. Maybe you can use more descriptive names than just 2 and 3.

All in all, very nice webpage! Completely useless, just as it should. Your code is very readable and I appreciate the pointers for what is what. Good job on the styling as well, the colors are very pleasant. Good job!
